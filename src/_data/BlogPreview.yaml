    descPreview: I continue cooking, you and I both forget about Pinkman. We forget
      this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long
      and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer Option B.  He’ll live. I asked
      to see you in order to… clear the air. There are uh, some… issues that
      could cause a misunderstanding between us and I think it’s in our best
      interest to lay the cards on the table. My brother-in-law, moments before
      he was attacked, someone called to warn him. I believe that same person
      was protecting me.  Those two men, the assassins. I believe I was their
      prime target, but that somehow they were steered away from me to my
      brother-in-law. Because of this ‘intervention’ I am alive. And yet, I
      think that this person was playing a much deeper game. He made that phone
      call because he wanted a shootout not a silent assassination.  In one
      stroke, he bloodied both sides – set the American and Mexican governments
      against the Cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the
      southwest. If this man had his own source of product on this side of the
      border, he would have the market to himself. The rewards would be…
      enormous.  We’re both adults. I can’t pretend I don’t know that person is
      you. I want there to be no confusion. I know I owe you my life. And more
      than that, I respect the strategy. In your position, I would have done the
      same. One issue, which troubles me, I don’t know what happens when our
      three-month contract ends. You know why I do this. I want security for my
      family.

    descPreview: He has enough money to last forever. He knows he needs to keep
      moving. You’ll never find him. He’s out of the picture. I saved his life,
      I owed him that, but now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you
      wanted, isn’t it. You’ve always struck me as a very pragmatic man so if I
      may, I would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me you
      have two.  Option A, you kill me right here and now. Apparently I’ve made
      that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses and then spend the
      next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him too.
      A pointless exercise it seems to me but that is Option A.
