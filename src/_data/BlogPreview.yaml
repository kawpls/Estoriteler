    descPreview: He has enough money to last forever. He knows he needs to keep
      moving. You’ll never find him. He’s out of the picture. I saved his life,
      I owed him that, but now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you
      wanted, isn’t it. You’ve always struck me as a very pragmatic man so if I
      may, I would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me you
      have two.  Option A, you kill me right here and now. Apparently I’ve made
      that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses and then spend the
      next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him too.
      A pointless exercise it seems to me but that is Option A.
